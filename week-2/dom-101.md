# DOM

## What is the DOM?

## DOM - Document Object Model

From the MDN:
<blockquote>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document (a tree) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once that event is triggered the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.
</blockquote>

The DOM is the means by which we will be interacting with our HTML in JavaScript.  This is how are are able to bind events and manipulate tags and markup on our pages.

When a web page has loaded in the browser, you have access to the elements via the document object.  This document object has methods by which we can query different parts of the page to traverse and manipulate markup.

## Getting a single UI element

```javascript

    // Gets the first h1 on the page
    var h1 = document.querySelector('h1');

    // Updates the h1 to show 'How are you?'
    h1.textContent = 'How are you?';

```

## Alternatives

- getElementsByTagName
- getElementById
- getElementsByClassName

## Generating HTML

- DOM elements (including `body`) have an innerHTML property
- It's a string
- When set, it updates the element's HTML content

```javascript
document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>Hello!</h1><p>This was generated</p>';

```

## Responding to events

- When the user interacts with the page, events are generated
- You can use JavaScript to respond to events
- (e.g. clicking, typing, submitting, etc)

Given this HTML:

```html
<input class="name">
<button>Submit</button>
```

You could write JavaScript which looks like:

```javascript
var txt = document.querySelector('.name');
var btn = document.querySelector('button');

btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
  alert('Hi, ' + txt.value);
});
```

## Events bubble up

- In our previous example, if we put our input and button inside a `.foo` div tag, the following would fire:

```javascript
document.querySelector('.foo').addEventListener('click', function () {
  alert('Foo was clicked!');
});
```

## Turning off the event bubble

- Say we wanted to cancel the event because we have handled it

```javascript
btn.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  e.stopPropagation();
  alert('Hi, ' + txt.value);
});
```

- Event handling functions can take an optional argument
- The `e` is the event object
- It has quite a few handy properties

## Preventing default behavior

- Say we had a form

```html
<form class="login-form" method="POST" action="/login">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <button>Login</button>
</form>
```

- What if we want to prevent it from submitting?

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('.login-form');

form.addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault(); // Stop the form from submitting
})
```

## Getting and setting attributes

```javascript
var txt = document.querySelector('input');

txt.getAttribute('name'); // returns the value of the name attribute
txt.setAttribute('name', 'username'); // sets the value of the name attribute
```

## Adding/removing classes

- There is a `classList` property
- It's only supported in IE10 and up
- An alternative is something like the following

```javascript
// Return an array of class-names associated with el
function classNames (el) {
  return (el.className || '').split(' ');
}
```

```javascript
function addClass(el, className) {
  var classes = classNames(el);

  if (classes.indexOf(el) < 0) {
    classes.push(className);
    el.setAttribute('class', classes.join(' '));
  }
}
```

```javascript
function removeClass(el, className) {
  var classes = classNames(el);

  classes = classes.filter(function (name) {
    return name != className;
  });

  el.setAttribute('class', classes.join(' '));
}
```
