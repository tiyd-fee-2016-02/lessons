# User Stories

User stories are short descriptions of a feature told from the viewpoint of the user. Each feature should have a user story associated with it.

The typical template is:

`As a <type of user>, I want <goal> so that I can <motivation for goal>.`

There are three essential parts of this template:

* The user's role
* The user's goal
* The user's motivation for the goal

When crafting user stories, you want to keep them as simple and subjective as possible. Avoid adjectives and adverbs like *easily*. Keep it quantifiable.

## Examples

* As a user, I want to be able to log in with my username and password so I can access my account information.

* As a user, I want to upload photos so that I can share my photos with others.

* As an administrator, I want to approve all comments before they are posted so that I can ensure they are appropriate.

Every feature should have a user story associated with it.
