# CSS Frameworks

If you've learned one thing so far, it's that building a website from scratch can be:

* Time-consuming
* Bug-prone
* Might not even work on all browsers

Ok, it's also a rewarding, creative exercise in problem-solving. But you don't always have the time to tackle all the _fun_ aspects of web development.

That's when you might decide to turn to a CSS Framework.

## What's a CSS Framework?

![Frameworks are kind of like SimCity](http://i.giphy.com/j0waQzelyMR0I.gif)

* Sets of pre-rolled grids & components
* Global CSS settings
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Can streamline design process
* Great for prototyping, but you'll see them in production as well
* For those familiar with HTML, CSS, JS but want to increase productivity

## What do Frameworks provide?

* Built in Grid
* No need to reinvent the wheel
* Kind of like a library of components and conventions that save us time
* Browser compatibility
* Best Practices already included and typically the code is scalable
* Using a standard codebase with a team can make your development work easier and decrease development time


## Twitter Bootstrap

* As of this writing, the most popular Framework
* And most starred project on GitHub
* Already packaged with some basic jQuery plugins like modals and carousels
* Works with CSS, SCSS, or LESS

## So! Many! Frameworks!

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
* And many more

## But there's some downsides

* Vanilla frameworks are boring & over-used
* Special sites should have special layouts
* Things can get over-complicated fast
