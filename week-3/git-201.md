# Git 201: Pulling, Cloning, Branching, Merging

## Pulling

Someone else has made some changes and you need them. Pull them down.

```bash
git pull
```

Or

```bash
git pull origin branchname
```

## Cloning

Want to pull an existing repo down to your machine?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kellymurray/c3-demo.git
```

The URL will vary depending on the repo you're cloning.


## Branching

Branches are

- Create a branch for your feature
- Commit to that branch
- When your feature is done, merge the branch into master

You want master to remain clean and good-to-go (shippable).

To create and checkout a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b gh-pages
```

- Creates the `gh-pages` branch and checks it out.
- `gh-pages` branch will be an identical copy of the previous branch


To check out (go back to) an existing branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

## Merging

To merge all changes from your branch into master:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge gh-pages
```

Master will now have all changes that were made in the `gh-pages` branch.


## Merge conflicts

What if:

- You change a file (say, `readme.md`)
- Someone else also changes that file, commits, and pushes it

Whose changes are accepted?

Git tries to merge automatically, but sometimes you'll see something like this:

```remark
# My fancy readme
<<<<<<< HEAD
Is pretty swank
=======
Is not so swank
>>>>>>> branch-a
```

You'll have to:

- Manually remove the weird markers
- Make the file look however you think it should

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolving merge conflicts in readme"
```
