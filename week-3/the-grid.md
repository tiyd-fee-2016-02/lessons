## First...let's talk about CRAP
* Contrast
  - example: size, bold, italics, caps
* Repetition
  - example: all secondary headers should look the same
* Alignment
  - content and elements that should be aligned are aligned
* Proximity
  - pieces of information that are meant to complement each other should be near each other

## It's a lot to keep in mind.
## Luckily, the Grid System helps you keep your CRAP in order.

## The Grid System

* A way to divide your layout into columns and rows with CRAP principles in mind
* You can easily find responsive grids with built-in breakpoints
* 9, 12, and 16 columns are the most common
* But you can play around with anything
* There's no rules to breaking the rules except know what you're doing
