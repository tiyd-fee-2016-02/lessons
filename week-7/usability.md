# Usability

People want to use things that are easy: easy to access, easy to understand, and easy to succeed.

**Remember:** If users aren't using your site (or using it for its purpose), then it doesn't matter how cool your site looks or what fancy JavaScript programming it utilizes!

## Effort vs Value

When effort outweighs value, users will bounce. Think about when a friend shares a link with you, but it's locked behind authentication or the site is difficult to use. How likely are you to sign up for an account or figure out the interface?

## Usability Testing

If you want someone to use something you've created, it's got to be usable. If you want them to use it a lot, they've got to enjoy the experience.

### Testing gives you outside perspectives

* Value it!
* Look outside your team and company
* Users might not (and often will not) use the site in the way you planned, or might misunderstand your work
* That's ok -- listen, find out why, and iterate
* _Do not stubbornly assume anything about the tester_
* Remember: they're not the one being tested. Your app is!

###  Determine the tasks to test

* Keep it small -- three is a good number
* Stay focused on MVP

### Identify Personas

* Who uses your site now (if it's live)?
* Who do you _want_ to use your site?
* Figure out their basic needs and any demographic details you have
* Use Personas to figure out the best testing group to give you the most valuable information

### Get creative about finding your testers

* Meet-ups
* Previous Users
* Hobby groups
* Social networking
* Compensation if you can - their opinion is valuable to you

### Use a script!

* There's no harm in using a script
* It's a valuable way to make sure you don't forget anything (boilerplate, time to start recording, etc.)
* Check out Spencer Krug's _Don't Make Me Think_ for good scripts

### Solution-Oriented

* Find a problem, report it, and if possible be Solution-Oriented
* Make recommendations
