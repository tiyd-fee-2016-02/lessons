# Design process

## Approaching new projects

- Requirements
- Identify MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Work on copy (content is king!)
- Wireframe
- Test / feedback loop
- Build / prototype
- Test / feedback loop

## Requirements

Deep understanding leads to good design.

- What is the problem?
- What is the solution?
- Challenge assumptions
- Approach from all angles
- What is the user's motivation?
- What is their context?

## Identify MVP

- Minimum Viable Product
- What's the least you can do to ship something useful?

## Work on copy

- Write text first
- Reduce it
- Reduce it again
- What does the user need to know here?
- Personas
  - Who are they?
  - What else do they like?
  - How are those things marketed?
- What is the tone / personality of the site?

## Example

- Redesign the Iron Yard landing page
- What does it need to say?

## Wireframe

- Multiple options
- Low resolution / fat marker
- Content-driven
  - Content drives design
  - Design does not drive content
- Consider the following
  - Is there an expected pattern/approach to the problem?
  - Guide the user's eye
  - Easily scannable content
  - Consistent alignment
  - Consistent representation of related elements
  - Hierarchy of importance
    - What is the primary action here? It should be big and clear

## Wireframes !== Mockups

- Wireframes are not mockups
- Mockups
  - Are high-resolution
  - Show color, font, styling
- Wireframes
  - Are low resolution
  - Focus on layout and functionality
  - Prevent client from getting distracted by color, images, fonts, etc

## Example

- TIY landing page continued
- What layouts communicate our mission?

## Feedback loop

- Rapid iteration, fast feedback
- Don't ask leading questions:
  - Bad: "What do you think happens when you click Submit?"
  - Good: "You accidentally added something to your cart and want to remove it. What do you do?"
- Bigger-budget stuff: eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, heat-maps, etc

## Build / prototype

- Prototypes
  - Supposed to be throwaway code
  - Never get thrown away
  - Turn into zombies

## Build / prototype (cont'd)

- Look at your wireframe
- Identify and name the components
  - Header
  - Main navigation
  - Profile summary
    - Photo
    - Name
    - Edit link
- Scaffold via HTML
  - Your names become CSS classes
- Style via CSS
  - Resets
  - Defaults
  - Structure / layout
  - Theme
  - Colors, backgrounds, fonts, etc

## Feedback loop

- Show your design when it's still slightly uncomfortable
- Get feedback often
- Ship often

## Example / exercise

Tasked with designing a shopping cart

- What is the user's context?
- What are their expectations?
  - Consistency same frame, colors, fonts, main-nav, etc
- What is their motivation?
  - Seeing their total?
  - Checking out?
  - Scanning the list to see if they missed anything or have too much of something?
