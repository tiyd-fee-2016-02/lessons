# Typography and Fonts

---

## Why should I care about fonts?

* The content may be incredible, but if it's difficult to read, you lose the reader's attention.

* "The web is 95% typography." - Oliver Reichenstein.

Unfortunately, only a handful of fonts look similar across all browsers and systems.

Web-safe fonts include:
  * Arial / Helvetica
  * Times New Roman / Times
  * Courier New / Courier

These are safe choices for legibility. You aren't bound to them, though.

# Why not try -- Web Fonts!

[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) is the most popular web font site and is free!

Free!

I said free!

And very easy to use. Let's try it!

# Fonts and CSS

* font-family and the font stack

* line-height
  * line-height roughly relates to leading in typography
  * line-height sets the height of an entire line of text

  ```css
    h1 {
	     font-family: Trebuchet, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
	     line-height: 1.4em;
     }
  ```
